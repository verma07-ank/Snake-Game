** Snake Game **
                                                        
The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult.

The player can also see their current score as well as high score.

Technologies Used - HTML, CSS, Java-script.
